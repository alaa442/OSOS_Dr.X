 Introduction to this article is an excerpt from a book about the American Civil War . The book was published in 1996, "The Battle of  Machine Readable file (“the file”) is to provide regression coefficients and intercepts for different components to calculate low, mid, and high (10th, 50th, and 90th percentile) material price estimates and labor multipliers/add-ons . The file provides a list of envelope and non-envelope components (e.g., Windows, Water He  Material Price Regression is a form of analysis to determine the value of a given product . The price of a product is a function of  The component & Class portion of the file shows the component, the class, and the output units . The “output units” column describes what the units of final output of  Each component is fitted via quantile regression to one of the applicable performance metrics . The performance metrics were chosen based on market research on pricing factors and customer needs . Some components, such as thermostats, have no regression analysis as there is no measurable performance metric associated with them .  Labor and Installed Cost of the installation in the U.S. is $1.5 million .  The total installed cost is calculated one of two ways depending on the component . The labor multipliers are separated out by “scenario” (new construction or retrofit) Retrofit scenarios include costs for removal or other demolition of existing components .  The second method to calculate the total installed cost is by using adders rather than multipliers . Labor for some of the components does not scale with increasing material or equipment price and has a constant installation cost . The values are therefore added to the material price regression results to  Installation costs are derived from the Technical Support Documents for the given appliance and averaged to create an installation adder . For technologies that do not have recent standards data available, installation costs were derived using a variety of available resources including RSMeans .

Please submit a photo of your favorite destinations in the  The last section of the file contains additional data not directly within the calculation of each component and product class . These include the expected lifetime (in years) of the component and cost variation considerations .  For cost variation considerations, the following implications may have additional impacts on pricing for each component .  Prevailing local wages are key to local businesses' success in the U.S. economy . Local wages are a key part of the  CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery .

Existing materials are also used in the construction of the project .  Moisture issues present at the site of the largest lake in the United States . Moistures are expected to be restored to normal  Condition of existing flue is same as condition of flue used to flush flue .  Need for condensate line/drain needs to be connected to the city's water supply network . Need for a line of cond  Need to bring in combustion air to keep combustion air alive . Needed to keep in the air of combustion air . Need to keep the  Condition of existing electrical system is same as existing electrical systems . Electrical system is similar to other electrical systems in China .  Presence of hazardous materials is at risk of being exposed to hazardous materials .  Nature/size of leaks is the size of the leaks in the world .  Extent of preparation includes preparation to prepare for the event .  Each regression was given a confidence rating in the categories of sample size (SS), median (R2), and source diversity, to qualify how robust the data and corresponding regressions are . If a dataset had a sample size above 100 data points, it was marked as "High SS" If the data set uses over two (2) different sources, it is "High Source Diversity"  Price Calculation Example . Price Calution Example . Use this example to test your knowledge of the value of a price .  Air Source Heat Pump (Retrofit Installation Multiplier)  The numbers in red correspond to the different coefficients in the flat CSV file for the two performance metrics and the low, mid, and high regressions .  Where A is the capacity in tons, B is the efficiency in SEER1, and C is the intercept value (constant)  To produce the total installed cost, use the retrofit labor multiplier . If this was for new construction, the new construction multiplier would be  The median material price is $9,826 and the labor cost is $4,913 for a total installed cost of $20,635 . The installation costs here include labor and equipment costs for demolition, removal, and installation .  Unfinished Attic Ceiling Batt Insulation (Retrofit Installation Adder)  The low, mid, and high retail price for replacing (retrofitting) ceiling insulation in an unfinished attic with an R-Value of 15, using fiberglass batt insulation . The numbers in red correspond to the different coefficients in the Machine Readable  Where A is the R-value coefficient and C is the intercept value (constant)  To produce the total installed cost, use the retrofit labor adder . If this was for new construction, the new construction adder  The median material price is $0.86 per square foot and the labor cost is $1.00 per square feet .
